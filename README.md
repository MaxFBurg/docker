Start a CPU container exposing Jupyter lab to port 9999 on the host machine:
```bash
dockerrun --env-file path_to_env_file -p 9999:8888 your-image-tag
```
Passing an environment file is optional. Possible to pass more arguments.

Start a container on GPU 0 exposing Jupyter lab to port 9999 on the host machine:
```bash
GPU=0 dockerrun --env-file path_to_env_file your-image-tag
```

Show list of running containers and assigned GPU:
```bash
